# Pokemon Chat App

I wanted to create a simple full stack application with Next.js, TailwindCSS and Supabase and I wanted to cover as many Supabase Services as possible. 
Here's what this app uses:
- Supabase Auth and Magic Link Password-less Authentication
- RLS (Row Level Security)
- Postgres Function
- Trigger
- Supabase Realtime
- PostgREST API
- Supabase Storage

### Sign Up with just a username and your email

You'll get a signup confirmation email with a link, following which will give you chat access.
